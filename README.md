Identifying the cell types 
and their spatial distribution 
in the spider silk glands of the bridge spider



Spider silk, the strongest natural fiber known to date, has generated a lot of attention from scientists. 
Different types of silks are produced by different spider glands in the abdomen. 
The primary dragline silk of the major ampullate gland is the most well-known and extensively studied but other silk also plays a crucial role. 
A better understanding of how the different glands work can help us to produce artificial silk. 


In this study, we present a high-resolution spatial map of the minor ampullate gland at a single-cell level. 
Our investigation has revealed the presence of five distinct cell types within the gland, and we were able to map their spatial distribution over the gland. 
These discoveries shed new light on the complexity and variety of spider silk production, which may serve as an inspiration for the creation of novel biomaterials with extraordinary mechanical properties.
